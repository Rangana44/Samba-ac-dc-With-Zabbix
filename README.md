# Samba-ac-dc-With-Zabbix
# Linux-Based Domain Controller with Active Directory & Zabbix Monitoring

This project implements a Domain Controller setup on a Linux server using Samba to emulate Active Directory functionalities, along with Zabbix monitoring for real-time system and network insights. It was completed as part of the Directory Structure and Network Management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu, windows, Fedora
- **Services**: Samba, Kerberos
- **Monitoring Tool**: Zabbix Server
- **Clients**: Linux & Windows machines (VMs)

## 📌 Project Objectives

1. Configure Samba on a Linux server to function as an Active Directory Domain Controller.
2. Set up Kerberos for secure domain authentication and synchronization tool like chronyd.
3. Join a client machine to the domain and authenticate users.
4. Install and configure Zabbix to monitor the domain controller and client.
5. Create a Zabbix dashboard for system health, authentication status, and network connectivity.
